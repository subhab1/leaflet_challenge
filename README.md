The goal of this challenge is to make an interactive web-based map to visualize earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), highlighting the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
## Background
This project aims to create an interactive visualization tool for earthquake data collected by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The USGS plays a crucial role in gathering and disseminating scientific information related to natural hazards, environmental health, and the consequences of climate and land-use changes. On a daily basis, the USGS accumulates extensive earthquake data from various regions across the globe.

The primary goal of this visualization tool is to empower the USGS in educating the public and government organizations about critical issues affecting our planet. By providing an accessible and user-friendly interface, the tool will enable users to explore and comprehend the wealth of earthquake data collected by the USGS. This initiative seeks to enhance public awareness, improve scientific communication, and foster a better understanding of the dynamic forces shaping our world.
